- 👋 Hi, I’m Kundananji
- 👨🏿‍💻 I’m interested in developing good quality maintainable software applications while being as effective and efficient as possible in terms of schedule and budget of the software product. My main focus is Full stack web development in web 2.0 then afterwards learn more about the web 3.0 and how the Blockchain system functions and how to develop it. My favorite and main programming language is JavaScript and its' associated frameworks and libraries.
- � I’m currently a student pursuing a bachelors degree in computer engineering and looking to learn more skills outside my curriculum because i am a junior.
- � I’m looking to collaborate on any software development projects so that i can gain more experience in the industry and diversify my skills and knowledge
